				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<img id="me" src="assets/images/Eric.jpg" alt="Pic of Me">

					<p>I was an underachieving student who became a late bloomer. Working a variety of jobs while trying to find direction, I finally graduated cum laude with a degree in Biology at age 28. From there, I worked in chemistry for four years, while pondering the next step, including potentially pursuing a graduate degree. 
					</p>
					<p>As the world is becoming more and more technologically connected, I've decided that the next step includes obtaining skills in computer science. Computer science is an incredibly powerful field, where some of the most exciting developments are taking place. It's a field that I would like to join and hopefully find a way to contribute to one day.
					</p>
					<p>In my spare time, I'm a generalist, whose ideal job would be professional student. I would also like to teach what I <em>have</em> learned along the way for whoever my voice might connect with. I have a wide field of interests including Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Writing, and Psychology just to name a few. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The world is such an interesting place - if only there were more time...
